Card Deck Program (Java)

Overview

This is a simple Java-based card deck simulation that includes functionalities like creating a deck, shuffling, dealing cards, and searching for specific cards. It uses OOP principles and consists of three files:

Card.java → Represents an individual playing card.

Main.java → Runs the program with user input.
